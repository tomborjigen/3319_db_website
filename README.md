# DESCRIPTION
3319 assignment 3 with MySQL and PHP

FIRST PAGE STARTS ON main_menu.PHP

This website connected to the MySQL database in the virtual machine provided by Western's CS department. The website would connect to the Database, and could display the information in the database, and could updaate it too. The first page was a main menu where all the other pages could be accessed. The first viewing page would display the database using the BOOTSRAP 5 CSS plugin to improve UI design. The other pages were HTML forms that would accept appropriate user input and then update the database accordingly. The backend was written in PHP to connect to and query the database. The generated HTML was paired with CSS and JavaScript to build the website. 

UPDATE:

Since the course has ended, the CS department has shut down the virtual machines to free resources. Consequentially, the website is no longer running,but all the PHP scripts, HTML, CSS and JavaScript files are here.
